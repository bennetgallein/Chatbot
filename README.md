# Chatbot
This is a basic Pattern Matching Chatbot.

This is a project for my school Paper about Neuronal Networks and Chatbots.

## Usage:
register a custom Pattern by using the following Lines of code:

```java
ArrayList<String> inputs = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("hi", "hello"));
ArrayList<String> responses = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList("Hello Man", "Huhu"));

Pattern pattern = new Pattern(inputs, reponses);
b.p.add(pattern);
```
And there you go.
